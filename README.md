# Final Project Description: HCMUS AUT Student Management System using Laravel

In my final project for Advanced Web Programming, I will develop a Student Management System specifically designed for HCMUS AUT (Ho Chi Minh City University of Science - Auckland University of Technology). The system will be developed using the Laravel framework and will incorporate several key features. The project will showcase my ability to implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, perform full CRUD operations, implement user authentication, and create a real-time dashboard with panels and charts.

### Key Features:

* MVC Architecture:

Implement the MVC architectural pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns and maintainability of the codebase.
The Models will represent the entities in your system, such as Students, Courses, Departments, and Enrollments.
The Views will handle the presentation layer, providing a user interface for interacting with the system.
The Controllers will handle the business logic, coordinating the actions between the Models and Views.

* Full CRUD Operations:

Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for the core entities in the system.
Allow administrators to manage student records, course details, department information, and enrollment data.
Provide user-friendly forms and interfaces for performing these CRUD operations.

* User Authentication:

Implement a login and logout functionality to distinguish between regular users and administrators.
Users will have limited access to their own profile and related information.
Administrators will have privileged access to manage student records, courses, departments, and enrollment data.

* Dashboard with Panels and Charts:

Create an interactive dashboard that provides an overview of key information and statistics.
Display panels with important metrics, such as the total number of students, courses, and departments.
Generate charts and visualizations to represent data trends, such as enrollment statistics over time or distribution of students across departments.
Make use of charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js) to create visually appealing and informative charts.

In conclusion, this project will allow users and administrators to effectively manage student-related information and provide valuable insights through the interactive dashboard.
